Flappy bird "clone" made to pratice game development in Rust.

This project is part of the book [Hands-on Rust - Effective Learning through 2D Game Development and Play](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/)

Still needs A LOT of improvements, but at least it's working...

In order to run you need the 2021 edition of Rust. Clone the repository, cd into the folder and run.
```
cargo run
```
